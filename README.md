# verification-tutorial

This tutorial is intended to teach a verification project in a story-like fashion, just like [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/building-a-menu-using-list) or [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/).

Although Keisuke Shimizu's has a brilliant [tutorial](http://cluelogic.com/) to teach SystemVerilog and UVM, I feel there is a need to teach language-agnostic verification concepts.
